## How it works?

This component has a very minimal styling footprint only setting the minimum to make it work, and you can extend the styling to fit your needs.

For extra customization this component it will also add extra classes dynamically depending on its state.

It will have the class `loading` while the image is been preloaded and `loaded` once it has been loaded.

Additionally it will have the class `fullview` while the user has not initiated the zoom and `zoomed` once the user has taped/clicked in.

On touch enabled devices users can use one finger to zoom in and move the zoom location by dragging the finder on the image, this will disable the scrolling. Touching with more than 1 finger on the image will not activate the zoom and page will scroll as normal, this was decided this way as it is easier to use one finger to zoom and drag on the image.

### v1.4.0

Change log:
- Fixed issue where dynamicly changing the src attribute in the component would not cause the component to re-render due to the props of the `ImageZooom` been destructured and losing the ref status.

### v1.3.0

Change log:
- Passing attributes properly down to the `figure` tag using `useAttrs`
- Clarified fullWidth behavior: when fullWidth is true the zoom fits the imageâ€™s natural width to the container, it does not upscale images smaller than the container and will fall back to the provided zoom value.
- Sizing and defaults
    - `width`/`height` props accept string | number and are normalized in `image-zooom.vue` (numbers become px; empty strings fall back to 100%/auto).
The rendered `<img>` uses `width: 100%; height: auto;` inside the figure.

### V1.2.0

Change log:
- Renamed the package from `VueImageZooom` to `ImageZooom` and updated documentation.
